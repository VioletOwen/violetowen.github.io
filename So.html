                             <p>So, God showed up. </p>
								<p>Yesterday was New Year’s, and I felt so discouraged. I wanted to see God’s glory, to see Him at work. I have heard of Him at work (perhaps it is the low that a high like CROSS conference creates), but I begged Him to do something. Nothing seemed to happen that night other than icy roads, which was a freak of nature and a display of His awesomeness. I went to a dance that I did not really want to go to, but I went anyways because I was a good friend and I wanted to have some “fun.” It wasn’t as fun as I expected it to be, as I was still somewhat sick and out of it. I didn’t dance well, so maybe that’s why I wasn’t asked to dance as much. Sometimes it is just so hard, it is hard to be the different one, to be counter-cultural. They hold watching movies and dancing as the ultimate “fun,” I view them more as diversions that don’t bring satisfaction. </p>
								<p>I had been thinking about not getting my period yesterday, and was minorly worrying over it, but it came last night. They used to be much more hit or miss, but now they’re usually in the range of 28 days to 40 days unless I miss one (like the last one—I probably was too stressed and had too much going on). </p>
								<p>Sometimes I wish that I was the same as other people, but I know that I will not be satisfied. But it’s so hard sometimes: saying no, making your own decisions different from others, standing out in a crowd, etc. </p>
								<p>I see why some Christians say that we shouldn’t celebrate Christmas—one is able to celebrate Christmas in all of its traditions without talking about God or the Gospel. It is SO sad to watch it—they think that they celebrate Christmas, but they have taken the Christ out of the occasion, the sole reason we celebrate it. </p>
