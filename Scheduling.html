                            <p>I am conflicted, I am somewhat confused. I do not know what I am doing—I have so many deadlines looming over me. So many I’s. I want to be able to be at peace, without the need to do anything. All my time is packaged, and part of the reason is that I want it to be packaged. Even though I could easily drop what I have to do, I still want to do them. It gives me a high: I love to feel that I am useful. That’s why I store so much information: it is useful and gives me an advantage over others. I don’t store information for the sake of it—information is costly, but I do store information because it is useful. I want to be able to not do anything: I want to sleep. Even in sleep, I still do things. Maybe that’s why I overeat: my whole life is too disciplined. There must be a balance: I need an outlet that will give me some sort of overflow, while being disciplined. Maybe writing will accomplish that. </p>
							<p>I wake up at 5:30, get out of bed at 6:15. I need to get out of bed at 6:00, which means that I need to go to sleep at 10:00. I have been decent at doing that so that’s a good thing. I also get pretty tired around then. I get out of bed at 6:15, wash up and get dressed. I start devotions at 6:20, which are supposed to go until 6:35. Then, I can workout until 7:00, when I have to go to prayer. It’ll be so much easier if I could do prayer at 7:15. I suppose that I have to get up at 6:05, wash up, and start devotions at 6:10, which goes until 6:25. I can then workout from 6:25-6:50, come back, shower, and get dressed for class, and go to prayer. Which means that I have to lay out what I want to wear to workout and to class the night before. If I have too much schoolwork for the day that is due, I’ll just skip working out. If I do laundry, I’ll put my stuff in at around 6:15, and the washer goes until 6:55, so I’ll transfer them into the dryer and then go to prayer. After prayer, which ends at 7:15, I can go back upstairs and pack my bag. I get breakfast at 7:30 and finish at 7:45 or 7:50, and go to chapel or study more or take out laundry. I’m going to start writing in the morning, no matter if it is just two sentences or an entire paragraph. The subject matter does not matter—it just has to be writing. I do need to practice writing academically: I am very rusty. This entire plan hinges on me getting up on time, which is a good and bad thing. I can’t promise this for weekends as I stay up late on Saturday, but it could work for Friday nights. </p>
