                             <p> Out of all the books I read, I would say that three books that affected my childhood years and highly influenced the way I thought. <i> The Little Princess, Elsie Dinsmore, and Jane Eyre. </i> I read <i>The Little Princess </i> when I was seven, or even eight. I can’t remember. It taught me to be gentle to all, calm under all circumstances, and imagine a better world when things go wrong. Most of all, I adopted the idea that crying was weak-- “soldiers never cry,” as Sara would say. From Sara, I learned to be quiet and tone down my responses, to be quietly strong and selfless. I am not so sure about the selfless part, but I am a very quiet girl now. I need to learn to speak louder, as my teachers often remind me. <i>The Little Princess</i> convinced me that imagination was a good thing and should be developed upon my mind. I still remember reading her telling Emergrade, her new friend, that dolls could walk and talk, and thinking that she was a funny child. Now, it is normal to me. I don’t see things, but I can imagine. Often, I can make them seem real, but never as real as Sara does. I have this book to thank for my imagination, and for my ability to write. Because I can imagine, I can write. I need to write every week, it has become like an obsession. But I believe that most artists have that sense of urgency, because I have asked around. <i>The Little Princess</i> molded me into a quietly artistic person I am today. That brings me to Elsie.</p>
							  <p><i>Elsie Dinsmore</i> taught me the treasure of the Bible and how to bear up under trials. In contrast to Sara, Elsie cries a lot. She, however, has a quiet strength in her that comes from God and stands very firm when her principles are challenged. From Elsie, I learned to be yielding when principles do not come into question and to not budge an inch when it comes. I, however, need to clear up my principles because they are somewhat rusty right now. Someday I will tell you mine and how I made them. I admired the way that Elsie could quote the Bible at will, and attempted to emulate her. I am still working towards it. Elsie, similar to Sara, is quiet and calm. Both of them are actually very pretty but they do not think so. This is somewhat unrelated, but these books gave me the impression that curly hair was pretty. I often need to remind myself that straight hair can be pretty too. <i>Elsie Dinsmore</i> held up a model girl that was quiet but strong girl, and I hope I am like that. Now we come to <i>Jane Eyre</i>. </p>
							  <p><i>Jane Eyre</i> is a romance novel, and yes it is. I can identify with Jane to a T, which is why I like this book so much. I value the mind and the character. I don't really care about their demeanor, or at least I think so right now. We shall see. I am like Jane in the sense that I can be polite but it often discomfits me. In fact, it makes me feel as if I am walking on eggshells. Because of my upbringing, I also have that sense of shyness around guys. I do not like guys in the normal handsome sense, which usually means muscular and humorous. <i>Jane Eyre</i> has not lived with me long enough so I cannot tell you the future benefits.</p>
							  <p>So I guess I am more English than I am Chinese. Or the American two hundred years ago. I do not enjoy the jokes Americans play on each other, or laughing at the pain of others. It’s terrible to laugh at other people’s failures. In the Bible, those who laugh at other people’s troubles will get the wrath of God upon their head. Imagine that. An Almighty God getting angry at you. You’re just a reed in His hand. He can break it in half without any effort. </p>
							  <p>I wouldn't exactly say I am English either, because I have not met many English people and they seem too similar to Americans for me to tell the difference. They are just not as direct or as fun-loving as the Americans as far as I gathered. I don’t exactly know. </p>
