                              <p>Today is one of those days where I must write. I must get my thoughts on paper. It is a good thing that it is Saturday; often I need to stifle this feeling because I have no time. </p>
							  <p>Actually, I have time, but when I do, I have more “important” things to do, such as studying or doing crochet. I get up at six A.M. in the morning but I often fail at it. Usually it becomes 6:30am or even later. I am somewhat lazy in the morning and my phone does not help that. My eyes are getting worse and I know that I need to do something about it. I get to school at 8:30 and am shut up in classes until noon. On the subway I work on my vocabulary and memorize words by rote. It gives me a sense of satisfaction but it does not come close to writing. I finish lunch at 2pm and do my homework. I am technically free after that but I make myself do math, logic, and extra homework. If I don’t, I won’t be able to stay on top of the class. Staying on top isn’t exactly my goal, because I started in the middle of the class, but it feels good to be close to the top. And scary because I know I would fall if I slack off. So it’s a two-edged sword.</p>
							  <p>I should be working on my Turkish or answering emails, but I am frankly too tired. I need an outlet, and only writing would satisfy it. You say that answering emails would help, but it does not offer that sense of relief because I need to phrase my words just right, convey exactly the amount of feeling I want to, and not offend my reader. Here, I am free from judgement. I hide behind a false name and people getting offended is the least of my concerns.</p>							  
							  <p>I grew up in Singapore, where I only did piano to feed my creativity. I hated drawing and nearly all things artistic. I liked structure. I loved schedules. Until I came to Turkey.I moved to Turkey when I was thirteen and I am still here at eighteen. It has become more and more oppressive and so I look forward to the day I am moving to United States. I went back to China two years ago and it nearly broke me. I cried myself to sleep over half of the nights and moped around the rest of the time.</p>
							  <p>If I walk in my community and do not pay attention to the signs, I feel as if I am back in China. I never felt that before. That feeling is getting to me and slowly stifling me. Whenever I close the window, I feel like I am a bird looking out of a cage. When I open the window, I feel like I am Winston in 1984. It was unbearable in China because I was plunged into it, but here it is slowly moving in. It feels like cooking a frog in warm water, and is ignorable at times. That’s why I have stopped going for walks, and turn to writing instead. This is one of the few mediums where I am anonymous and can have the freedom of speech.</p>
							  <p>Oh, you don’t know what freedom is when you have not experienced deprivation! Imagine watching all your words carefully to avoid people saying that you implied something. It is slowly appearing in Europe and States too, but at least the people do not face court cases from the government. Their amendments still protect free speech, in a sense, and their government is not very concerned with what people say about them. In the East, however, free speech is often waved around like an empty word. Leaders, especially ones in China, want to protect their name by controlling how people think about them. Like they could. In the end, their turn people into hypocrites, which make me mad. My mother says I’m young so that’s why I am upset. And I am influenced by the American way of thought. And I do not think it's true because I neither click with most of the Americans nor read a lot of American books. I prefer English writers and I can point to <a href="https://thoughts.cf/booksthatchangedme.html"> three books that changed my life </a>. But I will save that for <a href="https://thoughts.cf/booksthatchangedme.html">next time</a>.<p>
